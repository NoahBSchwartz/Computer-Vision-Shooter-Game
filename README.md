This game was created in 2019 as a final class project for my Introduction to JAVA course. It uses nearly all of the code from https://cell0907.blogspot.com/2013/07/tracking-ball-with-javaopencv.html with some slight modifications to run with modern tools. At the time, I had almost no experience dealing with Eclipse, multithreading, or JAVA Swing so I started by just building a simple shooter game that would take mouse input. I then used cell0907's code to make my mouse follow a moving ball in the frame. This let me have one program control the other so that I didn't need to worry about passing data between the two environments or slowing the game frame rate.
